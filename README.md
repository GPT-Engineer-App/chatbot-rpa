# chatbot-rpa

A Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool with a user-initiated chatbot interface. Upon pressing a start button, a chatbot, powered by GPT, pops up to take natural language commands for various tasks. The system is designed to learn tasks by observing user actions, asking questions to clarify task details, and performing tasks autonomously once learned. Features include intelligent task learning, conversation-driven task management, and the capability to execute tasks based on learned procedures.
